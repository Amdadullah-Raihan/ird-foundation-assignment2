# Project Name: iHadis Clone

## Description

This project aims to clone the UI of the iHadis website and implement the necessary backend functionality to fetch data from a provided database. The project utilizes Node.js for the backend, with endpoints to fetch books, chapters, sections, and hadiths from the database. For the frontend, Tailwind CSS and NEXT.js are used to replicate the design and functionality of the iHadis website, including the sidebar section for books and chapters, section cards, and hadith cards. Static Site Generation (SSG) is employed to pre-render the page for optimal performance. Additionally, the site is designed to be fully responsive.
